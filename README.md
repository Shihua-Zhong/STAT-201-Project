INTRO
Bike sharing systems are a new transformational method of transportation wherein the whole process from membership, rental, and return has become automatic. 

These bikes bring an array of sensors and are able to collect an abundance of user usage data including weather data, like temperature and humidity; timing data, like day and time; and user data, like count of casual user daily usage. The dataset identified in this study is from a two-year study of the Capital Bikeshare system program in Washington, D.C. during 2011 and 2012 (Fanaee-T & Gama, 2013). The dataset contains 731 days of data wherein each has 17 variables. The objective of this analysis is to determine through empirical methods if “registered” users of the Capital Bikeshare program have higher rates of usage during the work week than “casual” users to a degree of statistical significance. We will quantify this usage with proportion mean as a location parameter and standard deviation as the scale parameter.

For our analysis, two academic studies are deemed relevant. Kim (2018) found demand for bike rental usage is significantly more inelastic to heat on working days than non-working days. We believe it indicates this inelastic sub-population likely are commuters that rely on the service to arrive at work. In contrast, Hosford (2018) found that the implementation of a bike share program has little impact on increasing bikeshare program usage rates both among registered and casual users in the long-term.

METHOD
Throughout our analysis we hold the null hypothesis that registered and casual users have identical usage rates independent of the day of the week. Based on aforementioned academic research and our intuition as researchers, we set the alternative hypothesis that the proportion of registered users that use the bike share system is higher than casual users during the work week to a significant degree. 

The sample size used for our plots and estimates was large enough to produce close to accurate results. The use of bootstrap sampling has made it easier to derive the estimates for the proportions without having to use the entire sample or having the need to collect more data. Even though the results produced are good estimates they are not strong enough to prove or provide anything substantial. Calculating the 90% confidence interval for the average proportions of registered users will provide a range within which there would be a 90% chance of having the true proportions. We expect to find the two proportions are significantly different from each other. We expect to disprove the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis.

We expect to find estimates for the proportion of each weather condition in spring and winter and their respective 90% confidence intervals. Conduct hypothesis tests to find out if there are significant differences between the proportions of weather conditions for each season. We then further develop the trust of our report by offering measures of statistical significance, P-values.

This analysis could prove beneficial for marketing departments to better define target markets and allocate marketing efforts, or to better inform the placement of new automated bike racks to optimize for registered users.
